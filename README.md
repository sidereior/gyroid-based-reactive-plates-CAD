# gyroid-based reactive armor for combat robot - CAD
gyroid armor plates which i've been looking into for modeling new combat robot.
if you use this stl as a base for your design or for any other design I ask that you please do credit me.
if you have any questions or want to credit me reach out to alexanderlnanda@gmail.com.
file is saved as gcode because voxelization on my laptop would take ages to convert to stl. software i would reccomend is voxelizer3 and convert gcode to .stl
